## AWS VPC Flow Log

>Using AWS VPC Flow Log we can capture the information about the traffic going to and from network 
interfaces in our VPC network. And the logs will be published into AWS Cloudwatch Logs.


##### Step 1:

* Open Terminal

##### Step 2:

*  **cd** into  ` /home/vagrant/Desktop/Labs/AWS-Security-Training/vpc_flow_log/lab`

    ```commandline
    cd  /home/vagrant/Desktop/Labs/AWS-Security-Training/vpc_flow_log/lab
    ```

##### Step 3:

* Run `terraform apply`
**Note:** It will ask you permission to perform actions (`Do you want to perform these actions?`). Type `yes` and press `enter` to continue rest of the actions.

```commandline
terraform apply

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  + aws_vpc.ucsf-vpc
      id:                               <computed>
      arn:                              <computed>
      assign_generated_ipv6_cidr_block: "false"
      cidr_block:                       "10.0.0.0/16"


Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes
  
  
aws_vpc.ucsf-vpc: Creating...
  arn:                              "" => "<computed>"

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

##### Step 4 :

* Open AWS console on the browser and check the created `VPC`, `VPC Flow Log` and also check `cloud watch`. It creates a separate cloud watch group for VPC logs.

##### Step 5 :
 
 * Run `terraform destroy` to remove VPC from AWS.
 
 * **Note:** It will ask your permission to destroy the created VPC from AWS (`Do you really want to destroy all resources?`). Type 'yes' then press `enter`
 to continue the process. 
 
     ```commandline
     
      Do you really want to destroy all resources?
      Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
      There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.
    
      Enter a value: yes
      aws_flow_log.ucsf_aws_vpc_flow_log: Destroying... (ID: fl-0213b696e3b6c5c4e)
      aws_iam_role_policy.ucsf_vpc_flow_log_iam_policy: Destroying... (ID: ucsf_flowlogsRole:ucsf_flowlogsRolePolicy)
      aws_iam_role_policy.ucsf_vpc_flow_log_iam_policy: Destruction complete after 1s
      aws_flow_log.ucsf_aws_vpc_flow_log: Destruction complete after 4s
      aws_iam_role.vpc_flow_iam_role: Destroying... (ID: ucsf_flowlogsRole)
      aws_cloudwatch_log_group.vpc_flow_cloud_watch_group: Destroying... (ID: ucsf-aws-vpc-flow-log)
      aws_vpc.ucsf-vpc: Destroying... (ID: vpc-0abd67f8f4ffe1199)
      aws_cloudwatch_log_group.vpc_flow_cloud_watch_group: Destruction complete after 2s
      aws_vpc.ucsf-vpc: Destruction complete after 2s
      aws_iam_role.vpc_flow_iam_role: Destruction complete after 2s
    
      Destroy complete! Resources: 5 destroyed.
    ```
